## Introduction

GPT FlashCards Maker React is a powerful tool for creating flashcards. It leverages the OpenAI GPT API to make the flashcard creation process more efficient and user-friendly. Whether you're a student or a professional, this application will help you generate and organize flashcards for effective learning. This is also the first project of [CS5610 Web Development course](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2023/) at Northeastern University.

## Features

- **Flashcard Creation**: Quickly generate flashcards with questions and answers.
- **Easy Organization**: Create, edit, and delete flashcards with a user-friendly interface.
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: Utilizes the OpenAI GPT API for generating flashcards from text.
- **Export**: Download your flashcards for offline use or sharing with others.
- **Responsive Design**: Access your flashcards from any device with a responsive web interface.

## Final Project Update Features

- **Auto-Disappearing Error Messages**: Enhanced error messaging improves user experience. Error alerts now automatically vanish after a few seconds, preventing them from obstructing the view and ensuring a cleaner interface.
- **Operation-Dependent Button Disabling**: To improve user interaction, buttons for creating and generating cards are now disabled during processing. This change prevents multiple submissions and clearly indicates when an operation is in progress, enhancing usability.
- **Expanded Export Functionality**: Users now have more flexibility with the export feature. In addition to JSON, the system supports exporting cards in CSV format. This addition caters to different user needs and preferences, making data handling more versatile.
- **Redesigned Website Interface**: The website has undergone a comprehensive redesign. This update includes a new color palette and typography choices, aiming for a more visually appealing and accessible user experience. Minor improvements have also been made across the platform to enhance overall usability and accessibility.

## Design Document

See the [Design Document](./deisgn-document.md) file for details.

## Color Palette

The GPT Flashcards Maker employs a distinctive color palette:

- Success: ![#8a8834](https://placehold.co/15x15/8a8834/FFF) `#8a8834` - A greenish hue for positive feedback.
- Danger: ![#8a3435](https://placehold.co/15x15/8a3435/FFF) `#8a3435` - A reddish hue for warnings and errors.
- Primary: ![#34698a](https://placehold.co/15x15/34698a/FFF) `#34698a` - A calming blueish hue for main elements.
- NavBar & Footer: ![#262f35](https://placehold.co/15x15/262f35/FFF) `#262f35` - Dark gray for contrast and modern look.
- Card Background: ![#ffffe0](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffffe0/FFF) `#ffffe0` - Cream color for readability and warmth.

These colors enhance the application's aesthetics and user experience.

## Typography Matching

GPT Flashcards Maker employs two fonts for a blend of clarity and elegance:

- [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans): A geometric sans-serif font providing clarity and modern simplicity for body text and navigation.
- [Yeseva One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yeseva+One): A stylish serif font used for headings and titles, adding elegance and distinctiveness.
  This mix ensures readability while enhancing the visual appeal of the site.

## Code Review - Jishva Shah
You really did a good job! The website has a smooth flow and the code structure is clear and easy to understand. 
Here are some small things that i'd like to suggest:
1. The alerts displayed on screen can be implemented in such way that they disappear after some time, so that user don't have to click on 'x' everytime and alerts won't fill up the screen.
2. Also the alignment for creating flashcards can be better. Displaying them and generating them can be in two different pages.
Overall, really liked your website!
